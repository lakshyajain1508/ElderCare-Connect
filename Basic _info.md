## ⚛️ React Native

React Native is an **open-source framework** developed by Meta (Facebook) used for building **cross-platform mobile applications**.

* **Core Concept:** It allows developers to write mobile apps using **JavaScript** and **React**, which then render **native components** (like actual Android or iOS views) rather than web views.
* **Key Advantage:** **Code Reusability**. You can use a single codebase for both **iOS** and **Android** platforms, significantly speeding up development.
* **Performance:** React Native apps generally perform better than traditional hybrid (web-based) apps because they use native UI components.
* **Fundamentals:** It builds on core React concepts like **Components**, **State**, and **Props**.

## 🔥 Firebase

Firebase is a **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)** platform from Google that provides a set of tools and services to help developers build, manage, and scale web and mobile applications **without requiring deep backend server coding**.

* **Core Concept:** It handles the backend infrastructure, letting developers focus on the client-side experience.
* **Key Services:**
    * **Authentication:** Easy integration for sign-in methods (email/password, Google, Facebook, etc.).
    * **Cloud Firestore & Realtime Database:** NoSQL, cloud-hosted databases for real-time data synchronization.
    * **Cloud Storage:** Stores user-generated content like photos and videos.
    * **Hosting:** Fast, secure static web hosting for front-end apps.
    * **Cloud Functions:** Allows running backend code (serverless functions) in response to events.
* **Integration:** It integrates well with various platforms, including React Native, Web, iOS, and Android.
